git --help
	This will help you refer to the most used commands.
git init
	This will re-initialize git on your machine and allow you to run git commands.
	To add a new folder to git, go to that folder and initialize git there.  This folder becomes a git repository.
git status
	After you re-initialize, this will tell you what files are in the git working directory and which are being 
		tracked and not tracked.
git remote -v
	This will tell you all of the remote 'origins', or repositories your local git knows about.
	It is listed twice, which means it is available to push info to, and to fetch info from.
git push
	This is the simple command, once we have installed git, told it about our remote repo, and added files locally, 
	that will send our local files to the remote repo. git push origin master
	I could use this more specific command if I had more than one branch, or 'origin', but I don't right now.
git commit -m "Pushing some adds to gitstyle."
	This worked:
		$git init
		$git commit -m "Pushing some adds to gitstyle."
		$git push 
git config -l
	Lists the git configuration variables.
